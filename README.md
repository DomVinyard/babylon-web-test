## Netlify web test

I decided to reimagine the Babylon booking expirience.

The code is very simple, it's all in App.js. 150ish lines of (mostly hacky) styling and a little markup and state. Total time, 1 hour, 53 minutes. I wanted to do this in under an hour but I got sidetracked reading about the Sumarians. They were a truly remarkable people.

I would be happy to discuss the decisions I made in person over a coffee.

I hope you'll understand my decision to deviate from the instructions. All these tech tests are so similar, I'd go crazy writing the same boilerplate client-server apps over and over again.
